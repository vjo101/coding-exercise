### Coding Exercise

We are building software for brands that sell their products online. We will provide software to them to manage purchase orders, allocate stock from these purchase orders that will be pushed up to the sales  update their inventory levels. This coding exercise is meant to explore these concepts to give each candidate an idea of what real world problems we are looking to solve, to give us a chance to see what itâ€™s like to work together, all while assessing the candidates development skills.

### Your Development Environment
You will be running this on your local machine, using the IDE you are comfortable using. Please treat this like a real world scenario, and use the tools and resources you would normally use.

You will need to be running node 19 or higher. There is an `.nvmrc` file in the project. If you have nvm installed, you can run `nvm use` to switch to the correct version. 

### Requirements
It's likely we won't complete every requirement, but let's get as far as we can in the allotted time.

- Ability to see a list of purchase orders, create, and edit them
- Sensible validation for creation and editing of fields
- Error handling for the validation

### Starting Point

- Monorepo with NestJS and NextJS powered application
- Seeded database

### Tips
- Nest comes with [generators](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/crud-generator) to help you scaffold out your application. You can run `nx g @nx/nest:resource <name>` to generate a resource much of the boilerplate you need for purchase orders.

### To Start Exercise
 - Run `npm install --global nx@latest`
 - Run `npm install`
 - Run `npx prisma generate --schema apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
 - Run `nx run api:serve:development`
 - Run `nx run client:serve:development`

### Schema
Here is the schema we will use for this exercise.
![er-diagram.png](docs/er-diagram.png)
 - `parent_items` are the parent of `items`. Example: t-shirt or pants
 - `items` represent variations of items that we can sell. Example: t-shirt in red or blue
 - `purchase_orders` represent the document we use to track items we are ordering from vendors.
 - `purchase_order_line_items` represent the line items on a purchase order, and are linked to items.

### Explorations
In the technical interview process we will makes some changes to this code expoloring concepts such as ERP and Inventory. More specific requirements will be shared during the collaboration session.

We are looking forward to our pairing session soon!
